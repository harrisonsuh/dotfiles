# Harrison's Dotfiles

Taken mostly from Alex Dao :)


1. Install Powerline fonts (https://gist.github.com/1595572)

2. 
```
$ git clone git@github.com:harrisonsuh/dotfiles.git
$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ chmod +x setup.sh mac.sh brew.sh
$ ./mac.sh && ./brew.sh && ./setup.sh
```

3. Import color themes for iTerm according to preference and choose zsh theme on the .zshrc file as well.
